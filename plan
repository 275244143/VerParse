Action Plan for vnetsearch utility

- break up into multiple programs
  * Server
    * Pulls in data from -f files and builds the netlist object for parsing
    * will have a --status option that will allow running of this command and see what
      servers are using what ports
    * Parses and returns the following data:
      * file and line number of the definition of a net or reg
      * file and line number of the definition of a module definition
      * value of parameter of define in the minibuffer
      * files and line numbers of the loads of a net or reg
    * Receives commands from the client and returns the result to it
    * should run as a daemon
      * likely executed from within an end users compile script or similar
    * dynamically allocate ports from 55000
      * Check to see if lowest port is in use by sending a request
      * If in use, increment and try again
      * If no valid response, setup server on that port
      * If port in use is not 55000, rerun allocation routine to see if a lower
        port is available
  * Client
    * Sends a command sequence to the server and returns received data to STDIN
      or to the editor interface
    * Can also poll the servers on the local machine and see what is running
  * Editor Interface
    * Frontend for the client for an editor that allows keyboard shortcuts to
      issue client commands
    * Support for Emacs and vi
    * Emacs:
      * C-c C-s : search for net or reg definition
      * C-c C-d : search module definition
      * C-c C-p : print value of parameter or define
      * C-c C-l : find the loads of a net or reg, use M-n for next, M-p for previous
